# 1. Which product category that has the highest 
```SQL
- Select top 1 Product_NAME, sales
from Kultra_Mega_Stores
order by sales desc;
``` 

# 2. What are the top 3 and buttom 3 region in terms of sales 
``` SQL
Top 3 sales

Select top 3 region, sales
from Kultra_Mega_Stores
order by sales desc;
``` 
Bottom 3 sales
``` SQL
Select top 3 region, sales
from Kultra_Mega_Stores

``` 
# 3. what were  the Total Sales of applicants in ontario?

``` SQL
-Select top 10 discount, sales, Shipping_cost
from Kultra_Mega_Stores
order by sales asc;
``` 
- my advise  to the management of KMS to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers  is to either increse the discount  for the customers or reduce the shipping cost this  may motivate them to buy more. As shown in the data these customers have lowest discount  although their shipping cost is not high

# 5. KMS incurred the Most shipping cost using which shipping method ?
``` SQL
-Select Ship_Mode as Ship_Mode2,  
sum (shipping_cost) as
total_shipping_cost
from Kultra_Mega_Stores
group by ship_mode
order by total_shipping_cost desc
``` 
# 6. Who are the most valuable customer, and what products or services did they typically purchase?
``` SQL
select customer_name, product_name
-sum (Sales) as total_spent
from Kultra_Mega_Stores
group by customer_name, product_name
order by total_spent desc;
```

from [Kultra_Mega_Stores1]
join [dbo].[Order_Status]
on [Kultra_Mega_Stores1].Order_ID = [dbo].[Order_Status].[Order_ID]
``` 
# 11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the lowest shipping method and express air is the fastest.
but the most expensive one, did you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the order priority.
``` SQL
-Select Order_Priority, Ship_Mode,
    COUNT([Order_ID]) AS [order count],
    SUM(sales - profit) AS [Estimated shipping cost],
    AVG(DATEDIFF(DAY, [Order_Date], [Ship_Date])) AS [Avg ship date]
from  [KMS Sql Case Study1] 
group by Order_Priority,Ship_Mode
order by  Order_Priority,Ship_Mode desc
